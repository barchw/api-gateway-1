## New Features

- Change Ory Oathkeeper's scaling to be based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as Oathkeeper memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.
- Introduce APIRule in version `v2alpha1` [#996](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/996)
- Introduce migration procedure for switching from `v1beta1` to `v2alpha1` APIRule [#1170](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1170)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix rendering of APIRule list when multiple APIRules exist [#1069](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1069)
