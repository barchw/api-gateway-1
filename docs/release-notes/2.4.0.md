## New features

- Change scaling of Ory Oathkeeper to be based on CPU utilization only. This ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, since Oathkeeper memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.
- Introduce APIRule in version `v1beta2` [#996](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/996)
